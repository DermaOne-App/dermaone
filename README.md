## About the Project
DermaOne utilizes machine learning for image-based skin disease detection and cloud services to enhance accessibility. It also provides educational resources about detected diseases and maintains a history of user predictions.

---

## Learning Paths

### Machine Learning
- Dataset: 1,159 images, 8 skin disease classes (e.g., cellulitis, impetigo).
- Model: CNN with TensorFlow, utilizing normalization, augmentation, and Adam optimization.
- Results: Visualized metrics for accuracy and performance evaluation.

### Cloud Computing
- **Google Cloud Platform**: Used for cost monitoring, authentication, and resource storage.
- **Storage Buckets**: For image uploads and prediction results.
- **Cloud Run**: Hosts APIs for disease prediction and news features.

### Mobile Development
- **Android Studio**: Kotlin-based app with seamless integration of machine learning and cloud services.
- Features: Google Sign-In, image upload for disease prediction, health news, and prediction history.
